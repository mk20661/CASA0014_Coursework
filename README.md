# SoundDancing
  
An Arduino-based project designed to create a sound-reactive and light-reactive to control remotely Chrono Lumina through sound sensor, LDR, NeoPixel and MQTT,   
This project is the Assignment for CASA0014 Connected Environments. 

## Project Status ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. Major features are being implemented, and some functionalities are still in progress.

Welcome to the **SoundDancing** project! This idea is inspired by my own rhythm lights and my strong interest in the fusion of sound and light and shadow. In my previous projects, I designed a smart devices based on environmental data, the learning assistants that monitor the learning environment and sound playback systems. This made me realize that sound can not only be heard, but can also be "seen" in a more intuitive way. So,

## Features âœ¨

- [âˆš] **Light Monitoring**: Detect environmental light levels using a light sensor to adjust the brightness of Chrono Lumina Light.
- [âˆš] **Sound Detection**: Detect environmental sound using a microphone sensor to collect sound data, and using these data to control remotely the Chrono Lumina Light.
- [âˆš] **OLED Screen Display**: Display the option to the user to select the color mode (Single Mode and Random Color Mode).
- [âˆš] **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Transmit data remotely using the MKR 1010 WiFi board, control the Chrono Lumina Light remotely.
- [X] **Sound Processing**: Find a way to avoid the noise and other elements, which will influence the sound data **(Doing now)**
- [X] **User Alerts**: Provide a rotary encoder to let user can choose the color mode on the screen. **(Waiting to combine)**

## Progress and Roadmap ðŸ—“

### Current Progress:
- [âˆš] Light sensor test
- [âˆš] Sound sensor test
- [âˆš] OLED screen test
- [âˆš] MQTT connection test and public messages to topic test
- [âˆš] Rotary encoder test
- [âˆš] Combine the OLED screen and rotary encoder to achieve the selection function
- [âˆš] Combine the Light sensor and Sound sensor to control the Chrono Lumina Light remotely
- [ing] During the test processing, found the noise will influence the sound data collection. It need to a way to avoid this issue. Now, find two ways:   
**1.** Use the sample windows to calculate the average data  (on software part)   
**2.** Develop a filter to filter the noise (on hardware part)
